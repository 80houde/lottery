DeLotGame 是一款基于以太坊的预测游戏，玩家通过质押ETH获得DLT代币参与竞猜。首次质押1ETH=1DLT，后续按(质押ETH×总DLT)÷合约ETH余额计算。玩家发送含十六进制数据（如0x1A3F，最长16字节）的ETH交易参与游戏，系统会标准化数据并记录。每次投注时，系统会检查上次投注是否中奖：计算目标区块号上次区块+(10-上次区块%10)，通过EIP-2935获取该区块哈希末位字符，若该字符出现在上次投注数据中，则按(上次投注ETH×16×9)÷(数据长度×10)发放奖励（如1ETH投注+4字节数据=3.6ETH奖励）。玩家可随时通过redeem()或转账DLT赎回ETH，按(销毁DLT×合约ETH)÷总DLT计算赎回量。合约采用防重入保护，通过区块哈希验证确保公平性，但奖励结果受区块数据随机性影响。DeLotGame is an ethereum-based prediction game where players pledge ETH to get DLT tokens to participate in the guessing game. The first pledge of 1 ETH = 1 DLT, and subsequent ones are calculated as (pledged ETH x total DLT) ÷ contract ETH balance. Players send ETH transactions containing hexadecimal data (e.g. 0x1A3F, up to 16 bytes) to participate in the game, and the system will standardize the data and record it. Each time a bet is placed, the system will check whether the last bet is a winner: calculate the target block number last block + (10 - last block %10), get the last character of the block hash through EIP-2935, if the character appears in the last betting data, the reward will be issued according to the (last betting ETH × 16 × 9) ÷ (length of the data × 10) (e.g., 1 ETH betting + 4 bytes of data = 3.6 ETH reward). Players can redeem ETH at any time by redeem() or transferring DLT, calculating the redemption amount by (Destroyed DLT × Contract ETH) ÷ Total DLT. Contracts are protected against re-entry and fairness is ensured by block hash verification, but reward results are affected by the randomness of block data.
